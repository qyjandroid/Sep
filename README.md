# Use of Sep

1. npm i
2. npm run build

if you are developing a components, or you want to take a glance of components, run `npm run dev`, before that, you have to change the file name of `.babelrc` in to anything but `.babelrc`.

After that, please remember change this file name into `.babelrc`. Or our build command won't work well.
